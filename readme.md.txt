BUSSINESS PROPOSAL

Reasons for conducting our business over the internet

By utilizing the latest electronic, and informational technologies, and by designing effective and efficient systems and building in quality control, we aim to ensure the highest level of service, operations, and safety, all based around the needs, wants, comfort, and convenience of the customers and the client. This combination of technology, service orientation, and quality oversight will help keep costs at a minimum and maximize profits to the store and its investors. It also will help build the strong customer satisfaction and excellent reputation that will enable the online store to build solid, and crucially important, inter-store arrangements necessary to expand its scope and customer attraction in the early stages, and which will lead to continued long-term growth both within the target market area and, looking toward the future, beyond.

What the business will be doing: 
Style &luxury is a South African based company that’s based in Tshwane, Gauteng co-owned by 2 members. All its business transactions are purely based online – from signing up as a member to making purchases, the only physical business function that takes place in our company is the logistics part, particularly the delivery of customer goods to their nearest post-offices.
We offer online purchasing of furniture, because it is more efficient(less time consuming), and costs less money(transport fare money) to shop for furniture online, rather than going to the furniture store physically to purchase a furniture- only to find out that the furniture is not available, or having to search for the furniture store-by-store before finding what you’re looking for.
 Products and Services
We offer furniture made from all kinds of wood(trees)such as mahogany trees, Pine trees, Jacaranda trees, We offer variety of furniture from Dining Lounge suite, Bedroom suite, Kitchen Skim, Wall Unit those are the products we offer. 
We offer two services: 
 1) That’s the e-wallet payment service for the customer’s purchases to be successful. We open up a bank account for our customers, where they can bank money and only use it for purchasing our products, not for any withdrawal. When a customer makes a purchase for one of our products the price of that product is transferred from their bank account (the one we opened for them) into the company’s bank account 
2) The delivery of customers’ goods service, which we charge absolutely nothing for it.
